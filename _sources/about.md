# About


### Mission
* To support collaborative, reproducible and efficient data science in the SRM research community
* To equip researchers with computational resources in the cloud

This jupyter book is written to accompany a new cloud hub, which will be a deployment of a pangeo python environment on cloud computing resources, available to the SRM research community. Several initial resources are gathered here as described below, but this book is a work in progress, and we are looking for contributions from the community to help it grow!  



### Contents

* A new preprocessed archive of some common SAI simulations
* Code examples for working with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ARISE data store 

### How to contribute
Contributions are very welcome! Open pull requests or issues on the Github repo here https://github.com/alistairduffey/GeoCloud/tree/main

This book was inspired by the CryCloud project. See here (https://book.cryointhecloud.com/contributing/workflow.html) for a useful guide to the general process of contributing to Github based open source projects like this one.
